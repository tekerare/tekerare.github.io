  <h3>No Flaming Beyond This Point</h3>
  <p>these pages are themed around my <a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/One_True_Pairing" target="_blank">OTPs</a>. contents are built on transformative fanworks and don't necessarily adhere to their respective canon source material. if you find yourself thinking "this character would never say that!" or "i don't think this would ever happen," we follow a saying around here: don't like, don't look.</p>

    <h1>what are "shrines"?</h1>
      <div>
		<p>a "shrine" refers to a website page themed around a thing of choosing by the webmaster whom owns it. there are barely any constraints to what a shrine is. the only requirement is that the subject of choosing must mean something to the webmaster.</p>
	    <p>it was a webterm first coined amongst independent webmasters active during the 90's, and is still practiced by many today. you're looking at one of them.</p>
