  <h1>Shrines</h1>
  <h3>No Flaming Beyond This Point</h3>
  <p>my major shrines are themed around my OTPs. they're mostly built on fanworks and non-canon interactions. around here we follow a saying just as old as the concept of shrine pages: don't like, don't look.</p>
  <h2>Shrinelist</h2>
  <table><tbody>
    <tr><th><a href="slateshipping/">SLATESHIP - ノトルキnortluchi</a></th><td>nortluchi monoshipper temple</td></tr>

  <h2>What are "Shrines"?</h2>
  <div>
    <p>a "shrine" refers to a website page themed around a thing of choosing by the webmaster whom owns it. there are barely any constraints to what a shrine is. the only requirement is that the subject of choosing must mean something to the webmaster.</p>
	<p>it was a webterm first coined amongst independent webmasters active during the 90's, and is still practiced by many today. you're looking at one of them.</p>
