<h1>100 Questions for Webmasters</h1>
<h3>collect the blank form here</h3>
<p>if you're a webmaster who owns a website, you are eligible to <a href="https://mouseling.net/100webmaster.txt" target="_blank">fill this form out</a> as provided by <a href="https://mouseling.net/" target="_blank">mousecky @ mouseling.net</a></p>
<p>anyone else will probably die a horrible death at 12 am if they write a single character into this document idk.</p>
<h3>questionnaire: start!</h3>
<dl>
<dt>1. Please introduce yourself.</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i am tkr. i am doing this questionaire at 2025.11.14, so i've practiced handcoded web design for over 8 years.</p>
</dd>

<dt>2. How long have you been making websites?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>since i was in highschool.</p>
</dd>

<dt>3. And what got you into the hobby?</dt>
<dd><p>in 2017, i only really had minimal coding experience. i knew how to customize my forum profiles and summon images using bbcode. when i saw one user's personal homepage, i was envious that their website had a background with parallax effect, and they had custom graphics of their fursona that they were allowed to position anywhere they wanted (not just on a "main feed"). the world really is your oyster apparently.</p><p>anyway, i wasn't quick to begin learning html/css just because of that person's website, but upon the discovery of neocities.org i was gradually mastering the basics.</p></dd>

<dt>4. What kind of website are you most interested in?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>oshikatsu/fanfiction blogs, low tech resuscitation, and informational geodes of obscure stuff i didn't even know existed.</p>
</dd>

<dt>5. What's your workflow? Do you plan your websites out thoroughly or do you come up with the design as you go along?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>a little bit of both. i'll boot up gimp, draw an outline of where i want things to go, and work from there. i won't stay married to the initial sketch though, and won't deny my designs from evolving when i realize something better can be done with it.</p>
</dd>

<dt>6. Please link to your biggest inspirations.</dt>
<dd>
  <p>Visually, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050901000740/http://www.newgrounds.com/">2005 newgrounds.com</a> and (bear with me) <a href="https://www.marxen.design/" target="_blank">marxen.design</a>.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>newgrounds.com: i've taken a couple retired graphical assets that can be seen sitewide, but they were mutilated to the point that you can't really tell its even from here.</li>
    <li>marxen.design: with how long i've fought against minimalism, i've found embrace in it again. when corporate entities do it, you're like "i can tell this is to cut costs or to appeal to the layman," but it becomes a conscious choice when one man decides to do it. henning's industrial work inspired me even outside of site design.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>how bare it is that you have no choice but to count the twists in the tatami, because it being simple and monotonous does not mean there's nothing to scrutinize. those naked words is a person in his purest form. while i'm not brutalist whatsoever, i do what i can to de-abstract my life including my website.</p>
  <p>i talk about it somewhere on my blog, but i take inspiration from japanese newsprint and magazines i read and like to keep things visually compact so your eyes aren't walking around each corner of the screen.</p>
</dd>

<dt>7. What's your favourite part about making websites?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>watching everything click in place after i made an ambitious, page-breaking move.</p>
</dd>

<dt>8. And the thing you struggle with the most?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>organizing code like a normal person. i usually write what reads easier to me, but there's people out there who hate how i decided to format my css.</p>
</dd>

<dt>9. Do you keep the same layout on all of your pages? Or do you use different ones?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>technically everything is using the same script and css file but every subdirectory has a different backdrop and theres a few variations of the one graphic uniform seen everywhere. the fansites are the only pages not based in this uniform and even get custom theme palettes.</p>
</dd>

<dt>10. How confident are you with CSS?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>very.</p>
</dd>

<dt>11. Do you know how to correctly use &lt;dl&gt;?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>yes. it stands for "deez lists."</p>
</dd>

<dt>12. What is your favourite HTML element?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>&lt;table&gt; hands down. before i went semantically-correct i used to write tables as a foundation for all my column-based layouts.</p>
  <p>its cool at first because its an older website technique that people used to do... but i realize that screen readers can't read tables written for aesthetic-format all that stable.</p>
  <p>people only really used tables for layouts to solve what was lacking in css. we now have flex and grid though, so any layouts implemented through tables is out of ignorance or will.</p>
  <p>maybe my favorite element is actually &lt;a&gt; because it means someone liked a website enough to share it with me.</p>
</dd>

<dt>13. If you're making a new web page from scratch, what is the first thing you do?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>open up notepad++.</p>
</dd>

<dt>14. Do you know JavaScript?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>yes.</p>
</dd>

<dt>15. How about PHP?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>yes.</p>
</dd>

<dt>16. Does your website have a theme that you stick to?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>everything is themed around me.</p>
</dd>

<dt>17. Are you more focused on content or design?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>content.</p>
</dd>

<dt>18. Do you own a domain name? If not, would you ever want to?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i don't. i like the idea of having one but i'm pretty comfortable being financially constraintless to my current host.</p>
</dd>

<dt>19. What do you think of nostalgia-focused or "retro" websites?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i remember seeing my first retro website and feeling like i've uncovered an eden that "those poor socmed suckers won't ever have the pleasure of feeling."</p>
  <p>these days i prefer something i can actually read and learn from rather than a flashy website. i think i've seen so many self-labeled geocities inspired sites that they've lost their luster, but there's few sites where that's just the style and there's truly more to read within.</p>
</dd>

<dt>20. Is your HTML valid? Do you even check?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i use the &lt;center&gt; element pretty liberally so i know damn well it isn't, but it otherwise would be valid if i didn't.</p>
</dd>

<dt>21. What are your opinion on buttons and banners?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i still use [88 x 31] and [129 x 38] badges. they're good for showcasing my lesser known interests front and center without me having to write a whole post about it. i wish people made more funny badges and not just ones to advertise their sites, since those are the ones i use most.</p>
</dd>

<dt>22. What do you think of [88 x 31] button walls in particular?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>large button walls make me think of those army generals who fill their panels with as many medals as possible to overcompensate the fact that they haven't been there for that long.</p>
  <p>ideally you should have a small wall of badges that individually mean something to you. it's kind of embarrassing to see all these sites link to blogs that they clearly have never read because they end up linking to like, a racist person or something.</p>
</dd>

<dt>23. If you started over again, would you make something similar or completely different?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>same content, different design. i think i shared too much of myself with the world to think i can just play anonymous.</p>
</dd>

<dt>24. Are you envious of other people's websites?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>nah. i made what i wanted to make. the only thing i ever get envious of is complicated css animations, but it's nothing that my site ever needs. when i implement it, i realize that i don't really like it all that much too.</p>
</dd>

<dt>25. What text editor do you use?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>notepad++</p>
</dd>

<dt>26. Why do you use that one?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>it's just a website, don't need anything too crazy. i have like 6-10 raw ideas sitting on the tab bar that i don't even have to save, and there's a search + replace function so i don't have to replace tags or certain terms manually.</p>
  <p>very fine for simple markup, but there's definitely much more mature applications out there.</p>
</dd>

<dt>27. Do you host your image files on your web server, or on another host?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>on my own server. being self-reliable is always the move and hosting anywhere else just puts you in the frontlines to be breached and/or violated.</p>
</dd>

<dt>28. This might not be relevant to you, but what's your opinion on the Neocities vs. Nekoweb debate?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>nekoweb has too many bells and whistles for a hosting service that leave a bad taste in my mouth.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>there's this feature that allows you to customize the front page thumbnail preview that's  <a href="https://cereza.bearblog.dev/nekoweb-review/" target="_blank">not only exploitable</a>, but it even existing already means its designed to make its users more dependent on the webhost than the sites they're hosting.</li>
	<li><a href="https://mkultra.monster/tech/2024/10/15/i-can-t-recommend-nekoweb-a-neocities-alternative/" target="_blank">vpns aren't allowed</a> and they force you to turn it off to sign up. why should the user have to compromise just to use a tool? where's the priorities?</li>
  </ol>
  <p>i don't host on neocities anymore, but i can at least appreciate kyle drake's "outsider" involvement in neocities as opposed to plastering himself all over it. that's how any hosting service should be.</p>
  <p>who cares, neither of these are my hosts so plug into which ever guy you prefer giving your login data to.</p>
</dd>

<dt>29. How much server space would you estimate your main website takes up?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>534 mb. most of the occupied space is delegated to my art.</p>
</dd>
<dt>30. Do you keep local backups of your files?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>you should be editing locally.</p>
</dd>

<dt>31. Do you prefer simple or highly visual websites?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>depends what you're using the website for. highly visual websites are good for projects that want to say something through art, but simple, static ones will say more through written.</p>
</dd>

<dt>32. Do you stick to certain colours? Do you do that on purpose, or is it your subconscious?</dt>
<dd>i tend to stick to browns, reds and greens. my monochromatic pick is usually in pink or black/white. it's usually subconscious.</dd>

<dt>33. Have you ever thought about quitting? Why?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>not at all.</p>
</dd>

<dt>34. Do you have many webmaster friends, or is it a solitary hobby?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>webmaster <i>affiliates</i>, sure, but what happens in the button wall stays in the button wall. i don't want other people to interfere with how i present myself online, so it's a hobby i keep to myself by choice...</p>
  <p>i like teaching people html/css if they haven't touched it before though.</p>
</dd>

<dt>35. Do people in your real life know about your website?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i actually designed my website for people i know in real life to encounter it. even strangers.</p>
</dd>

<dt>36. Do you update your website very often? How often is "very often"?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>on a monthly range, i'll add new pages or images. on a weekly range, i'll fix typos or reword stuff to my liking to better convey my current thoughts on whatever that page is about.</p>
</dd>

<dt>37. And the overall design, do you change that much? Why or why not?</dt>
<dd>
  <p><a href="https://archive.ph/VmOS0" target="_blank">everything's structurally stayed the same</a>, save for a few aesthetic updates and now i run scripts to put in the global changes for me.</p>
</dd>

<dt>38. Is your website more you-focused, hobby-focused, or outside world-focused?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>most subdirectories will focus on the hobby/subject being shared, but are usually not related to anything outside of their confined spaces except for "i like them". in the end, i'll share ways that i show my love for these hobbies so it eventually circles back to how it is about me and why i want the outside world to understand them.</p>
</dd>

<dt>39. Do you do web design professionally?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i've done freelance design before.</p>
</dd>

<dt>40. If not, would you like to? And if you're comfortable answering, what do you do for work?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>n/a, freelancing and part-time.</p>
</dd>

<dt>41. Do you communicate with people by email very much?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i have to + i prefer it since i keep tabs on commissions this way.</p>
</dd>

<dt>42. Some people reject social media and use websites as a replacement. Do you keep social media outside of your website?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i still use social media because of my artist circles; virality is almost vital to freelance work. i've already found happiness in maintaining a self-reliable sanctuary of my own. i don't really reach for sns beyond looking for fanart.</p>
</dd>

<dt>43. How about instant messengers? Do you use a mainstream one like Discord or Telegram? Or something like Matrix? Do you avoid them?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>just discord for those i meet online. if not that, by phone number. anything else is overkill.</p>
</dd>

<dt>44. Do you listen to music while you work on websites? If so, what kinds of artists?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>not while i'm writing the contents. when i'm designing i listen to autechre, cautosome, evigt mörker, proc fiskal. ambient techno keeps my attention span in check.</p>
</dd>

<dt>45. Do you keep everything you make on one website, or do you have more than one?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>one website, but i plan on opening up another domain for 21+ explicit illustrations.</p>
</dd>

<dt>46. On a similar note, do you keep to one topic on your site, or many?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>many.</p>
</dd>

<dt>47. Do you present your real self, or at least try? Or do you construct a persona on purpose?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i believe everyone sections/cuts up parts of their real selves whether they try to or don't, this is just a nature of our social hierarchy. i am definitely only sharing a piece of myself that i feel comfortable sharing online, but it is already something i consider intimate for the online world. all that matters is that you know my expression is honest.</p>
</dd>

<dt>48. Have you ever made a good friend thanks to your website?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>no</p>
</dd>

<dt>49. Are you happy with the way HTML and CSS currently work?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>no. we should get rid of both of them actually.</p>
</dd>
<dt>50. What are practices that you think people should avoid?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>if you're going to overlay images on an entire page, please style it with "pointer-events:none;" so people can actually click on the links its covering. or just dont have overlaying images whatsoever, put them in the background.</p>
  <p>also, what's with these new webmasters not hosting on their own servers? they're hoisting their entire site shells through discord and catbox from the ground up. are the current wave of neocities webmasters all this stupid</p>
</dd>

<dt>51. What about under-utilised practices, or things you think people should do more?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i'd like to see more people learn javascript.</p>
</dd>

<dt>52. Do you use a lot of semantic HTML? Or are you guilty of generic structure?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>everything on my site uses semantic html. i'm kind of still unlearning my nesting-table habits and i try to keep my &lt;div&gt; count low, and its been a pretty smooth transition.</p>
</dd>

<dt>53. Do you consider different browsers?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>not only do i consider them, but i go out of my way to make sure the website is still legible without scripts since thats what keeps my website together. it's... not the same as functional since the scripts call all maps in, but as long as you can read the contents, it should be fine.</p>
</dd>

<dt>54. Speaking of, what's your preferred browser? Convince your readers why they should use it.</dt>
<dd>
  <p>mozilla firefox or its fork, librewolf. while firefox isn't exactly as private as it's been built up to be by its cult following, it has proactive cookie protection and it doesn't eat chunks to use. it  also allows css preferences, and its developers are relatively transparent about what runs in the background.</p>
  <p>not a lot of people understand how large of a profile your online data rolls into in just a few link traverses. if a browser is willing to consider your privacy, that's a good foundational relationship between the user and the developer already. i'd still advise you tick around in firefox's settings though.</p>
  <p>firefox is known for logging its development at a much slower pace but because of its customizable &amp; open source nature, chances are there is a firefox fork to solve whatever's itching, like slow pageloads and whatever.</p>
</dd>

<dt>55. And what OS are you on?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>debian. my portable runs the general-purpose raspberry pi os, and the one i use for video games is on windows 11.</p>
</dd>

<dt>56. Do you have a strong opinion on that, or do you just happen to use it?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i like to play with toys.</p>
</dd>

<dt>57. Are your websites mobile-friendly?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>my website will shake hands with a mobile, but they're only acquaintances. nothing more than that.</p>
</dd>

<dt>58. What are your thoughts on autoplay?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>don't do it if you want people to trust you.</p>
  <p>laymen don't realize the difference between html, or css, or javascript. if you're autoplaying music and nobody can't see the element to pause it, a passerby is just gonna think that you are running scripts without their permissions.</p>
</dd>

<dt>59. What are your thoughts on webrings? Are you in any?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i think webrings are more fun to be a part of if everyone's site is cohesive to the webring theme.</p>
  <p>i don't join big ones like the "self-insert" webring; its too many people, and commonality is too broad that i can't imagine anyone including its members feels truly linked to each other. no shade.</p>
  <p>i am part of the gosurori webring "cult of usakumya," as the fashion is heavily ingrained into your life if you partake in it. the investment is a serious thing, and you'll usually find a lot of the girls in this ring talking about it openly as opposed to a hobby that you are on-and-off about.</p>
</dd>

<dt>60. Do you have any web shrines? What do you like to see in that sort of page?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>please look for yourself [@ landing > shrines] i own a couple shrines for my fictional otps. i write them with other fans in mind, but its actually even better if people who have never heard of the ship before are introduced through my writing.</p>
</dd>

<dt>61. Are your websites "cliche", in your opinion?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i will write about things that i deem aren't written about enough, but i  won't get upset if i fall into a cliche. one of my otps is one of the most popular ships in a really popular media.</p>
</dd>

<dt>62. What is your ideal website? Are you striving for that, or for something else?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>a site that properly captures my present day. i'll also have to accept i'll never reach the ideal since i also believe that an active website is one that is consistently updated.</p>
</dd>

<dt>63. Are you an artist? Do you draw or design your own assets?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>yes, and i created about 97% of visible assets (not including font files or external site badges.) anything that doesn't belong to me or is transformative of another piece of visual work is credited in my about page.</p>
</dd>

<dt>64. What are your favourite resource sites?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>the ones i wasn't looking for.</p>
</dd>

<dt>65. Is there a habit you just can't get away from no matter how hard you try?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>using spaces instead of tabs.</p>
</dd>

<dt>66. What's your biggest advice for a new webmaster?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>writing html is like writing a google docs but without the buttons that turns things into titles or centered text. all that html does is direct when the text starts and stops being a title or stops being centered text. if you can understand that, then you've already mastered the basics of html.</p>
  <p>css is your real enemy. the best way to learn css is to reverse engineer. if you're trying to understand how someone made their text turn red when the cursor hovers over it, right click + view page source.</p>
  <p>finally, get ready to suck really bad at html/css. you will NOT know how to do it in one, two, or even fifteen tries. it's a hobby based in trial and error.</p>
</dd>

<dt>67. Do you keep all your styling in CSS? Or do you hard-code some?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>if something is special enough to have its own page, chances are its special enough to have its own subdirectory and i best convey the connection between these pages through visual theming. i'll hardcode something if its completely islanded off from the rest of the website and isn't meant to be referenced elsewhere onsite.</p>
</dd>

<dt>68. What do you think of frameset layouts?</dt>
<dd>
  <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091027060640/http://hk.geocities.com/saki_charmmy/main.htm">this site comes to mind</a>. it looks cool. unfortunately screen readers can't read anything inside of iframes.</p>
</dd>

<dt>69. How about table-based layouts?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>[see question 12] i used to use them, its actually pretty bad practice and you shouldn't fall for it like i did for 2 years.</p>
  <p>the "m" in html (which stands for markup) cannot be stressed more. the whole point is to <i>mark</i> the structures they're supposed to be in correctly, and tables will just not read the contents you want to display properly on search engines or readers, which makes it kind of disability-hostile.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>if you want to use tables though its no skin off my back. you are way better off using css flex or grids because tables will cause more invisible problems than they do to solve the visible ones.</p>
</dd>

<dt>70. Do you subscribe to the ideas of "one-column", "two-column" and "three-column" layouts? Do you use any of these?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i'm not sure?</p>
  <p>if this refers to column-stacking, i only design this kind of thing for corporate websites. since the average person is going to browse through a mobile viewport (anything that'll be linked on an equally mobile-designed app, like instagram or xitter), then the site should expect those kinds of visitors as well.</p>
  <p>my website isn't modular, and will always stay in the same viewstate no matter the column format.</p>
</dd>

<dt>71. Do you spend longer on the HTML or the CSS?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i spend some chunk of time figuring out where the scripts will generate which html lines, but not nearly as much time as i spend arranging my css lines.</p>
</dd>

<dt>72. Have you ever made a page with no CSS? It's useful for your thoughts.</dt>
<dd>
  <p>sure i have, but it never stays.</p>
</dd>

<dt>73. Do you ever find yourself making layouts with nothing to put on them? Or do you only make layouts when the need arises?</dt>
<dd>
  <p> i'm just not as layout-thirsty as i used to be, so i don't make spares on the side unless i've already figured out which page it'll accompany.</p>
</dd> 

<dt>74. Would you consider yourself a beginner? Or advanced? Somewhere in the middle?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>advanced for someone self-taught, but average in any professional setting.</p>
  <p>in terms of webmastering, im advanced at being myself on my own website, which should be enough.</p>
</dd>

<dt>75. Do you have a habit of looking at the source code of websites you visit?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i used to peep at code where the sun don't shine. i don't do it as much unless i want to download a font or image.</p>
</dd>

<dt>76. How did YOU learn how to make websites?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>viewing source codes. copying code is actually how you develop a muscle for creating + understanding it.</p>
</dd>

<dt>77. Do you ever force elements to do things they're not supposed to?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>they generally follow my instructions so there's not a whole lot of struggling. this is why you follow semantics and specify max/min dimensions.</p>
</dd>

<dt>78. Thoughts on floating elements?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>the float was literally created to wrap around text but i always reach for css flex for some reason.</p>
</dd>

<dt>79. When you're sizing stuff, what do you use first? Do you use px, em, %, or something else?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>for corporate, i either use percentages or the viewport units (vh, vw).</p>
  <p>for my own layouts, i will always choose px as i enjoy mimicking older static layouts.</p>
</dd>

<dt>80. Do you have a favourite font?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>a few: ms gothic, epson mincho, and pritchard std.</p>
</dd>

<dt>81. Would you run a website with another person? How would that work?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i couldn't run another website longterm (like updating it.) the most i can do is create a one-off artistic project that sits on another domain, but i couldn't be assed to do any sort of collaborative site upkeep. too much time for a control freak like me.</p>
</dd>

<dt>82. Do you surf the Web to find new personal websites very often?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i'm on neocities and wayback a lot, but i don't seek personal websites as much since too many of them are aimless or too loose about the things they talk about. its not their fault, but it makes browsing super boring for me since these personal websites double as testgrounds full of mutilated embeds and dead links. its not very fun to go through.</p>
  <p>the real gems are usually encyclopedics such as <a href="https://hubbardian.neocities.org" target="_blank">hubbardian</a> and <a href="https://rosewhip.neocities.org/" target="_blank">rosewhip</a> (curated by <a href="https://cadnomori.neocities.org" target="_blank">fox/cadnomori</a>) @ neocities. these are media fansites devoted to timeranger and yu yu hakusho respectively. i didn't realize i needed to know how to dye my hair like sion, but now i do.</p>
  <p>another great encyclopedic site is <a href="https://nevada-outback-gems.com/" target="_blank">nevada-outback-gems.com</a>, a prospecting page so thorough that you can even take virtual tours on some of the turquoise mines in nevada. only one guy takes all these pictures, and you know this because one of the virtual tours is incomplete and signed with "need to get my new digital camera out the mine site!!"</p>
  <p>a completed fansite is usually a good sign of a passionate writer who owns an equally passionate personal homepage.</p>

<dt>83. Do you bookmark other people's websites? How would you feel knowing someone else bookmarked yours?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>yes, because i'm planning to steal their code. also if someone bookmarked my site i'd be blushing and twirling and shit.</p>
</dd>

<dt>84. What do you want people to be most impressed with when they see your website?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i want them to be impressed by my incredibly advanced 1%'er coding knowledge. like knowing what an imagemap is and knowing how to summon more than one background property value.</p>
</dd>

<dt>85. Are you interested in technology outside of websites? Do you collect?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i like to play with toys (raspberry pi and arduino kits).</p>
</dd>

<dt>86. How often and for how long are you online?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>online enough to know what my friends are up to throughout the day.</p>
</dd>

<dt>87. When it comes to your website, who is your target audience?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>my own friends and people i meet at real life events.</p>
</dd>

<dt>88. Have you ever been interested in XHTML?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i've been pretty vocal about striving for consistency in all things i use, so i'm not opposed to adapting the site to xhtml.</p>
</dd>

<dt>89. Do you program in general? Have you ever written a program for use with or on your website, not counting simple JavaScript?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>not regularly because of time availability. i've written stupidly simple stuff (c or js), but nothing usable to warrant sharing on my site just yet. i will say that i have an open-source project that i'm on and off about releasing and i've even debuted it at a convention in 2025.</p>
</dd>

<dt>90. Speaking of programs that help you make websites, what do you think of static site generators (SSGs)? Have you ever used one?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i've nothing to think of them as i don't use them. i most likely won't ever need to use one either.</p>
</dd>

<dt>91. Do you keep a hitcounter? Why or why not?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>no. i had one before and considered bringing it back, but the catch is i'd rather have a counter for special visitors on the shrines rather than my landing page.</p>
  <p>however i try to keep as many third party services uninvolved in my business if i can help it. so i have to say no to any hitcounters.</p>
</dd>

<dt>92. Do you frequent forums? Which ones?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>yes. i'm on the ones you're on.</p>
</dd>

<dt>93. Do you write your page content directly into the editor, or do you prepare it elsewhere, like a text document or a Word document?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>it's all written in-editor, but any narrative works are backed up on a separate drive for anything of that nature.</p>
</dd>

<dt>94. Do you think you appear cool to others? A more accurate answer now: do other people ever say you're cool?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>they do. and they're right.</p>
</dd>

<dt>95. Are you embarrassed of your old work? Have you ever deleted everything out of shame?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i'll get rid of things without updating the rss and just pretend i've never written it but i'm not even really embarrassed, i just erase things because they hold no meaning to me anymore.</p>
  <p>i will say that i regretted deleting things out of nowhere, such as my postal 2 and sam &amp; max shrines. those things are gone forever until i revive them to fit my currenthood.</p>
</dd>

<dt>96. Would you close down your website if you couldn't update it, or would you leave an archive?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i can't imagine why i'd stop updating this site unless i was actually dead. ideally i'd leave it up. if it ever gets taken down, then that means i moved on to make another website and didn't think tkrpage felt like me anymore.</p>
</dd>

<dt>97. Do you reveal a lot about yourself on your website? Or are you more secretive?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>online life is only precious when its all you have, and that's just simply not all that i have.</p>
  <p>i'm up to so much bullshit in real life that i don't really care anymore about sweeping the tracks between my reality and online perception. well outside of blurring strangers from my pictures. i'll share just about anything i think my readers deserve to see.</p>
</dd>

<dt>98. Are you willing to reveal who your best online friend is, and/or if they have a website?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>no.</p>
</dd>

<dt>99. And do you optimise the images on your website?</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i'm certain every single image was ran through gimp with the lowest and highest dimensions allowed for them in mind, though there's a couple images i want to convert into jpgs. it's not high priority.</p>
</dd>

<dt>100. We're out of time! How do you feel after answering 100 questions? ....other than exhausted.</dt>
<dd>
  <p>i got some energy in the tank, so i'm going to go draw fanart to post on those shrines i won't shut up about. hope you learned something from my answers.</p>
