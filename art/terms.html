<h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
<h4>general commission info</h4>
<ol>
  <li>A "commission" is defined by the time it takes to work on a request, not exclusive ownership of an artwork. Every serviced image is explicit property of the artist.</li>
  <li>Terms of service may change at any time. Slot holders will be informed of updated terms during queue.</li>
  <li>All payments (USD) are taken through Ko-fi unless otherwise specified.</li>
  <li>TAT for each piece will vary from a week to months, so request deadlines upon discussion.</li>
  <li>Price negotiations are allowed.</li>
</ol>

<h4>before you order...</h4>
<ol>
  <li>I am a character artist! Please play into my strengths.</li>
  <li>Have a reference sheet or image at the ready.</li>
  <li>It helps to tell me what you are using the design or art for during the composition stage.</li>
  <li>Do not contact me on Twitter because I won't read it.</li>
</ol>
<center><b>Composition sketch &rarr; Flat &rarr; Rendering</b><br><span style="color:#00000050;">This is what the service process will look like.</span></center> 
<h4>queue &amp; payment</h4>
<p>Payment upfront, or talk to me about a two payment arrangement. For two-payments, 50% upfront and 50% after delivery.</p>
<p>Full refunds are issued if commissioned pieces haven't been started on record with visual proof. A refund after the composition sketch can be discussed.</p>
<h4>image rights &amp; usage</h4>

  <p>I reserve the right to post work-in-progress screencaps and finished works on my SNS (Social Network Service). By publishing or resharing my works, you agree to the following terms.</p>
