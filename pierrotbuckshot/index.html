  <h2>What Is The Amazing Digital Circus?</h2>
  <p>A girl wakes up to a cacophany of tense color, adopted as part of an ensemble of circus game characters who lived in the ring.</p>
  <p>They weren't non-playable characters, but humans who have fallen into the same virtual pitfall as her having trapped themselves into a VR headset. They barely remember much of their original human identity, forgetting their names upon arrival.</p>
  <p>All means of mortal control filter into the hands of their game vessels; a walking polygon, a fragile ribbon, a resilient ragdolly, an amnesiac king, a toony bunny and so on...</p>
  <p>TADC is an independent comedy visual webseries developed by <a href="https://gooseworx.newgrounds.com/" target="_blank">Gooseworx</a> about the absurdity of adult people living in an educational kid's game (reminiscent of 90's MS-DOS games) in complete isolation with nobody but an AI ringmaster with countless quests up his sleeves. It's not everyone's taste, but I warmed up to it (hard) and find it a very cute show.</p>

  <h2>What Is Pierrot Buckshot?</h2>
    <p>In fandom the commonly used term <b>Funnybunny</b> refers to works featuring a character pairing between Pomni and Jax.</p>
    <p>The sixth episode "They All Get Guns" was dubbed the Jax X Pomni episode for its contributing romantic subtext to the ship, hence the <b>"buckshot"</b> part. The <b>"pierrot"</b> part of course comes from Pomni's jester motif, and a <b>"buck"</b> is another term for a male rabbit.</p>
