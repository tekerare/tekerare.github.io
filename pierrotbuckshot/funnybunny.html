  <h2>What Is FunnyBunny (Pomni x Jax)</h2>
  <p>I actually didn't think much of the pilot when it first came out. The humor just wasn't my speed; it teetered inbetween an Invader Zim level of "random" humor (which I like) that was comfortable enough to watch, until followed by a few millenial-isms (which I don't like). Not too demanding of a watch, so I just shrugged off the project and was into other things.</p>
  <p>The pilot didn't do much to explore Pomni as a person as it mostly serves to tell the workings + inescapable fate of the Digital Circus's macrocosm. Instead what eventually solidified her as my favorite character was her <b>assertion, emotional intelligence, and playful side</b> displayed throughout the series, and it was grounded in mostly her interactions with Jax.</p>
  <p>She doesn't hide exploring the depths of her circus neighbors; she shows gratitude to Ragatha's (kinda hopeless) efforts, receives advice from Kinger when least expected, and empathizes with Gangle as well as standing up for her when she's at her most stressed.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, Jax is <b>a jerk to everyone since frame one and is reserved by choice</b>. His history with the rest of the cast spans into years, yet those who have been at TADC for longer than he has don't even seem to know much about his private/prior life or any of his avatar gimmicks (like what his avatar does when he holds his breath, why he breaks the fourth wall, etc.) He keeps it that way too, never getting closer to the other characters and actively antagonizing them.</p>
  <p>Around August 2025, I went through and coped with a breakup. When we had an argument I felt like I couldn't change because the resentment for me ruined my drive to get closer.</p>
  <p>Even though Pomni has seen all the nasty sides of Jax with others and in private, I felt comforted to see Pomni give Jax a chance and I feel comforted when she fights (literally) to preserve their relationship, even if it doesn't work out in the end. She didn't have to empathize with him, but she chose to and that's important to me. It also kind of comforts me to see someone as avoidant as Jax existing in media. This pairing helped sober me up and leave the past behind.</p>
  <h2>Gummigoo: How Can I Make This About Funnybunny</h2>

    <dd><p>"Ragatha, where's Pomni?"</p><p>"Huh? Oh, she's <b>flirting</b> with the gummy guy. 'Cause she'd rather be with the NPC than with us, or something. I wish someone would flirt with me."</p></dd>
  </dl>
   <p>Gummigoo is a one-off NPC that shows up in episode 2. Previously an antagonist of the Canyon Candy Kingdom adventure, he and Pomni get stuck in an out-of-bounds character model room and becomes self-aware.</p>
  <p>While short-lived, Gummigoo is the very first friend that Pomni connects with and despite being new stuff herself, she invites Gummigoo to the living quarters with her in hopes that he feels less isolated upon his self-awareness, and maybe lives there with her to share solidarity in how little they fit in.</p>

    <dd><p>"I guess I just don't want you to feel like you're nothing. I don't want anybody to feel like that."</p></dd>
  </dl>
  <p>Gummigoo couldn't stay after all since NPCs aren't allowed in the lobby (so he's more of the punchline and he's literally snapped out of existence by Caine) . His last appearance/impression on Pomni would be in episode 4, where she says her last farewells and rests her memory of him. After Pomni bonds with and mourns that NPC variation of Gummigoo, that's when Jax begins to display a more obvious interest in her.</p>
  <h2>Episode 5: Recap</h2>
  <p>Jax's interest in Pomni can be subtle for both the cast and the viewers. For implied years he's devoted to pranking, swindling, and straight up bullying to the point of desensitizing everyone. Throughout the episode, he manipulates Pomni several times into telling him simple details about herself (you know, like rather than just asking direct questions). In the President Pomni segment he tries to learn her favorite color by making her defuse a bomb [<a href="https://youtu.be/L4p2gN2CzsA?si=pn2z1tE4W1UDIPTH&t=331" target="_blank">x</a>], and in the Noir Bar segment he tricks her into telling her age by asking if she's old enough to have a job [<a href="https://youtu.be/L4p2gN2CzsA?si=d5qA6ssgLFJ9Snh_&t=747" target="_blank">x</a>].</p>

    <dd><p>"Oh yeah, I didn't give you [a brief] because I wanted to see what you'd do."</p></dd>
  </dl>
  <p>Ever since Ragatha said Pomni was flirting with Gummigoo, it seems Jax overheard her and started taking initiative to get Pomni's attention multiple times in his own strange, backhanded way. In the second lightning-round adventure, his prompt is centered around Pomni where she's president and Jax plays into a character of what everyone (or at least Ragatha) thought was Pomni's type; an Australian. Like Gummigoo.</p>
  <p>Over the series runtime Pomni becomes more comfortable with her new life in the digital environment, and reluctantly humors the adventures. We get a lightning-round adventure thats just about stargazing, and Pomni learns that the adventures don't always have to be intense.</p>
  <p>"Stargazing" being a soft-temper adventure, we finally get to hear him speak down to Earth for the first time. In this sequence he asks Pomni if she thinks Gangle can truly feel happy, which reinforces how Jax's perception puts their gimmicks and tropes first before anyone's humanity.</p>
  <p>His attachment to tropes is an eye he trained to have, wanting to read others first before they can read him. After being confronted by Ragatha for bullying Gangle, Pomni also confronts him "I didn't think you cared about what other people like." [<a href="https://youtu.be/L4p2gN2CzsA?si=D8Mc9d7qMa097-L0&t=491" target="_blank">x</a>] and it catches him off guard. (What did he expect?)</p>
  <p>Knowing how he spent most of the episode trying to talkstage her, it's actually really pathetic to see how he goes about making friends, but it somehow works on Pomni. After the bar sequence and the transition into "Good Ol' Fashioned Softball", Pomni starts empathizing and fixating on him the entire time at the bleachers, now knowing as much as she does about him such as his loss of unnamed friends. As Jax gives Evil Pomni attention [<a href="https://youtu.be/L4p2gN2CzsA?si=Fy-n4hi7j2AfW7cz&t=1124" target="_blank">x</a>], she's the only one against the grain on Jax's maid costume vote.</p>

  <h2>How I See Their Dynamic</h2>
  <p>Pomni and Jax both want to see themselves in each other. Jax seeks escapism (at the expense of others), and Pomni seeks company and a parallel that she can see herself in, whether it's a real human or an NPC.</p>
  <p>What I really enjoy about FunnyBunny is that even if Jax doesn't always take Pomni seriously like he should, he still sees her as an equal and goes out of his way to involve her in his business, when he usually keeps others at armslength (and has for years). Episode 6 for example!</p>
  <p>He could've just made fun of her or made her feel lame for considering pacifism during a gun brawl, but he doesn't. He shows her how to lose her realism, wanting to share his fun with her. He's become an outlet for her from all the shock and hardships of being stuck in TADC, and is the first person to make her laugh after maybe a week or two in the circus.</p>
  <p>Pomni's raw playfulness and shameless curiosity totally captured my heart. Even if she's on the timid side, she's never a doormat and often confronts or has advice to give to those who need it. She's the exact type of person who can handle Jax, and seems to keep Jax in his place. As her equal, he helps bring out her most comfortable self and lets her be "evil".</p>

  </dl>
  <p>My most ideal iteration of FunnyBunny is usually when Pomni's the one leading or being dominant... To be honest, I'm not really a fan of  anything with height-teasing or Jax leaning on her head, just because it's too cliche and Pomni wouldn't like that kind of thing anyway.</p>

    <dd><p>"I thought a position of power suited you."</p></dd>
  </dl>
  <p>My favorite fanworks are those where Pomni has more life experience than Jax while he's timid in uncharted territory. That guy can't hold a serious or emotional conversation whatsoever. In any scenario where he actually decides to take something seriously, I'd find it funny and realistic if he looked like a deer in headlights (and you'll find its my favorite expression to give him in my own fanart).</p>
  <p>The pairing has a hint of "doomed to snuff out." Something worth exploring even outside of the ship is <b>Jax's habit of compartmentalizing people into imaginary boxes."</b> Because of it he will objectify even his friends as though they are lab experiments.</p>

    <dd><p>"Or you could toughen up! I wanna see what your funny cartoon body does."</p></dd>
  </dl>
  <p>It's commonly discussed in fandom he does this to cope with the new bodies, ignore that they're still humans with new bodies, to predict people before they wrong him, and/or to test the lengths of said bodies. Whether he ends up amending with Pomni is really up to him dropping this habit.
