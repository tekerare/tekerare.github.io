	  <h3><a onclick='changeAudio(0)'>▶ Tim Exile - Sliiime</a></h3>
	  <p>An abstract IDM track from Tim Exile's &quot;Pro Agonist&quot; (18+). Just when you thought you could identify a word of English, its already molted into some un-human buzzing synth with each acoustic pluck. It's one of my favorite songs that only my favorite characters have the honor of holding as an &quot;anthem&quot;.<p>

	  <h3><a onclick='changeAudio(1)'>▶ Narrow Head - Gearhead</a></h3>
	  <p>A "noise rock" track from Narrow Head's &quot;Moments of Clarity&quot;. After the wick slicks clean into a final textural roar, no longer suffocates the miner once trapped in his wool and his sweat, for the water welcomes him. A brooding track that perfectly captures resentment and weight.<p>

	  <p><a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Emergency_Transport?file=EmergencyTransportPress.gif' target='_blank'>Emergency Transport</a> was sent to scavenge the metropolis while the rest of the squad is held back at the research quarters. He passes the time salvaging signals on his ham radio while hauling back spare tires.</p>

	  <h3><a onclick='changeAudio(4)'>▶ Tim Exile - Listening Tree</a></h3>
	  <p>The transmissions grew erratic the deeper Emergency Transport walked into the sporic nest. He hugs his radio's earpiece reluctantly to his ear awaiting the next order, but the cycling melodies suddenly grew rhythmic. His transmissions promised fresh air to wastelands which hasn't seen green grass in forever; the oddest part was how convincing it all sounded.</p>
