  <h2>The Parallel Of Two Heated Slabs</h2>
<div>
  <p>Norton and Luchino have a lot in common. They were both considered the wheelhorses of their respective fields, so obsessed in their goals that they eventually go to break some sort of ethical boundary to achieve their goal and eventual demise. Norton went to blow up a  <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Golden_Cave' target='_blank'>mountain</a> before fleeing off-the-grid for prospecting work, and Luchino was taken advantage of as he self-experimented venom samples. Their work also leads them into an affinity with the trascendent, grotesque creatures they cross roads with.</p>
  <p>They've been marked by Gla'aki &amp; Yidhra respectively and transform beyond human identity in their own ways (or at least are outcasted by those around them in some way). The way they approach these transformations and their individual desires make them a compatible, suited, pair if hypothetically to meet.</p><p>Norton is the instinctual preservation to Luchino's self harm, and Luchino is the apathetically humorous to Norton's ticking, serious, intensity.</p>
</div>
<h3>Ties In Lovecraft</h3>
<div>
  <p style='color:#00000070;'>Disclaimer: Identity V lore is designed to be undefined and vague. While I share most of fan loric consensus, I have some of my own invented interpretations in the following section.</p>
  <p>Luchino's tale is somewhat of a transhumanist one. The specimen his <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Dr._Duquein_Thompson' target='_blank'>coworker</a> gives him comes from a deity <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Dream_Witch' target='_blank'>Yidhra</a>, one of the cryptic beasts I was referring to in &quot;Themes of Ambiguity&quot; and shares the name of another <a href='https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Yidhra' target='_blank'>Yidhra</a>. While not directly involved with the manor and her goals aren't stressed, she's moreso a metaphysical force of nature and &quot;high stakes pest&quot; that <a href='https://id5.fandom.com/wiki/Lakeside_Village' target='_blank'>eventually crosses the manor</a>. Not much is known about the entire collective of Yidhra's metamorphosis's effects, but I like to think Luchino's transformation progresses on the same rate as Norton's.</p>
  <p>Luchino writes about his developing insanity and turning unhuman &mdash; post-human. He writes about having came to terms with his human ignorance knowing that he won't ever understand &quot;all the answers&quot; and gives up the endless search for &quot;Point B&quot; of science. Instead, he pursues pleasure in his new body where he can define the final destination of his experiments and accept complacency, where the world's logic can't and modern scientific collaboration no longer suits him. Before he can even grow his tail he's already accepted the life of a cold, natural predator.</p><p>Norton also has history with another <a href='https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Glaaki' target='_blank'>otherworldly force named Gla'aki</a> (this time, it is literally Gla'aki). Unlike Luchino, it didn't take long for him to accept that his curse would change his chances of freedom. Norton even sought after his curse and since remained loyal to his original goals, not experiencing the green decay (until decades later into the future according to HP).</p>
  <p>Where Luchino's curse ended his, Norton found his career.</p>
</div>
<h3>Their Dynamic</h3>
<div>
  <p>Luchino spent his life in observation and Norton never had family or friends to humor his problems. Despite them both being introverted and self-sustaining, they learn for the love of it. They may touch base about each other's fields of work as they both envy the fruit of knowledge and that want to learn would keep their bond fresh for years.</p>
  <p>Luchino and Norton would keep each other at armslength when first meeting, but eventually develop a long term friendship and bond over that which they can't reach but adore, like the stars that represents Norton's freedom and Luchino's knowledge. I can imagine them having a late-night whiskey next to a banker's lamp. The night tells the time Norton found pockets of a rare type of salt after a cave flood and Luchino tells his field travels in India. When Luchino asks Norton if he's ever traveled overseas, Norton tells him he's never made it out of Britain outside of when he was contracted to another site on the margin. Maybe Luchino would encourage him to apply to the sciences; you can't see the stars from under the tunnels your entire life after all.</p>
  <p>There's also just something melancholic about two servants of greater forces finding comfort in each other because they're the only ones who'll have bonded over it and seen each other before Yidhra's transformation and the <a href='https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Servant_of_Glaaki' target='_blank'>Green Decay</a>. It makes you wonder what'd they'd do to support each other from their godly abductors, or how they'd feel if they failed to help at all. What if they both watched each other become something else over time; would Norton find solidarity in  reptilian skin as firm as his own burns? Would Luchino mourn Norton succumbing to the green decay's zombification? Does Norton envy the academic life Luchino was gifted?</p>
</div>
<h3>Community Reception</h3>
<div>
  <p>In earlier seasons it was controversial to romantically pair hunters with survivors. Luchino x Norton would've been considered a toxic/problematic ship alongside <a href='https://shipping.fandom.com/wiki/JosCarl' target='_blank'>others</a> likely because of literal interpretations of ingame matches where a hunter can <a href='media/jeffthekillyou.jpeg' target='_blank'>jeff the kill you</a> and send you on a coaster-ride abomination that either sends you back to the manor or explodes upon impact. That or because Luchino is unhuman.</p><p>As Identity V became populated with newer/younger generations of players Luchinort media isn't nearly as popular today as it was before. With the introduction to &quot;alternate identities,&quot; people are a lot more accepting of these types of dynamics since a hunter can also be a survivor at the same time.</p>
