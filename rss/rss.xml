      <title>2025.08.23 // photo album moved to microlog</title>
      <pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2025 07:26:38 -0500</pubDate>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>i don't enjoy demolishing files on a whim but i've grazed off /jfashion/photoalbum.html and moved all contents to a new directory /microlog/</p>
<p>i didn't like how the microlog was hidden behind two links, but i also didn't feel like manually copying each microlog entry into RSS to remind everyone where it was (it's too many logs to keep track of longterm.) so it's front and center on the landing page.</p>]]></description>

<p>i whipped up an <a href="https://texaskissrhinestone.github.io/stream/" target="_parent">onsite mount</a>  to watch my streams from. drop by 2pm - 4am cst and chat with me.</p>]]></description>
